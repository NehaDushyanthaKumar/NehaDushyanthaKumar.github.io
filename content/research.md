## Sub-Neptune Atmospheres 

**Undergraduate Research Assistant** | **Pennsylvania State University**  
*Duration: January 2025 -  Present*

Atmospheric signatures of CO2, CO, CH4, and NH3 lead to false positive identifications of water-rich Hycean worlds, habitable surfaces, and biosignatures (Dushyantha Kumar et al. In Prep). Previous interpretations of JWST observations of the sub-Neptune K2-18 b reached conflicting conclusions about whether this planet is a water-rich Hycean world or a conventional rocky-core sub-Neptune. Motivated by these discrepancies, I conducted a detailed analysis of the impact of intrinsic (interior) temperature and vertical mixing – parameters that are observationally unconstrained yet critical drivers of atmospheric chemistry – on standard atmospheric models and predicted molecular abundances.

## Super-Puff Atmopsheres 

**Undergraduate Research Assistant** | **Pennsylvania State University**  
*Duration: Januray 2024 - January 2025*

TOI-3757b is an extraordinary exoplanet—a massive super-puff with a density of just 0.27 g/cm³, making it 1.08 times the size of Jupiter but less than 0.3 times its mass. As the only known low-density massive super-puff orbiting an M0-dwarf star, TOI-3757b presents a compelling puzzle: why does it maintain such an inflated radius despite its proximity to its host star?
In this project, I used PICASO atmospheric modeling software to investigate two plausible mechanisms driving the planet's anomalously low density: high internal temperature and low atmospheric metallicity. By systematically varying parameters including the Fe/H and C/O ratios, eddy diffusion coefficients (Kzz) at different pressure levels, and intrinsic temperature, I generated atmospheric models to predict molecular abundances and transmission spectra. My analysis revealed that TOI-3757b's equilibrium temperature of 759±13 K is too low to explain the inflation through external heating alone, suggesting that internal temperature plays a critical role. The models demonstrate that a hot interior drives disequilibrium chemistry through quenching effects, reducing methane (CH₄) abundance while enhancing carbon monoxide (CO) presence. Transit depth variations of approximately 360 ppm between 100K and 500K internal temperature scenarios provide testable predictions for JWST observations.

## GEMS Collaboration 

**Collaborator** | **Remote**  
*Duration: December 2023 - Present*

I collaborate with the GEMS-JWST team, an international research group studying Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars using the James Webb Space Telescope. Learn more about  the team at [gemsjwst.github.io](https://gemsjwst.github.io/team.html).
