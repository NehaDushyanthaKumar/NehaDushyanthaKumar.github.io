**Abstract Title**: The Role of Intrinsic Temperature and Vertical Mixing in Characterizing Sub-Neptune Atmospheres.

**Abstract**: Sub-Neptune planets are typically modeled with a dense rocky or metal-rich core beneath a thick hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere; though their bulk densities could also reflect a water-rich interior with a thin H/He atmosphere. The overall composition of K2-18b, inferred from James Webb Space Telescope atmospheric spectra, remains debated in part due to differences in modeling assumptions. While previous studies explored variables such as stellar spectrum, atmospheric metallicity, and carbon-to-oxygen ratio, they often assumed fixed intrinsic temperatures (Tint) and eddy diffusion coefficients (Kzz) - two critical, yet observationally unconstrained, drivers of atmospheric chemistry. To address this, we present a self-consistent grid of models that covers the full plausible range of Tint and Kzz using the open-source PICASO and VULCAN codes to better characterize sub-Neptune atmospheres. Focusing on K2-18b analogs, we demonstrate that modeling Tint and Kzz significantly alters methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia (NH3) abundances. These abundances enable our models to accurately reproduce published transmission spectra assuming both sub-Neptune and Hycean-world compositions. Our work highlights that comprehensive parameter space exploration of thermal and mixing parameters is essential for accurate interpretation of sub-Neptune spectra.

**Talk** | **Princeton University, NJ**  
*Duration: June 16, 2025 - June 17, 2025*

**Abstract Title**: Mini-Neptune or Water-World? Investigating methane abundance as a key atmospheric tracer.

**Abstract**: The detection and interpretation of methane in exoplanet atmospheres is an important tool for assessing planetary habitability. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of K2-18b - a super-Earth in its star’s habitable zone - revealed methane features in a hydrogen rich atmosphere, prompting debate over whether the planet is a Mini-Neptune (an exoplanet with a small rocky core and a thick H/He envelope) or a water-dominated Hycean world (with water-rich oceans beneath a thin hydrogen atmosphere). As methane can be produced through atmospheric processes or could serve as a potential biosignature, quantifying the assumptions of our atmospheric models is essential for correctly classifying these two exoplanet populations. I will present the results from my investigation into whether Mini-Neptunes can produce similar methane abundances as Hycean Worlds. By systematically varying key parameters - such as atmospheric chemistry, internal heat, and vertical mixing - I will discuss their influence on methane abundance in our atmospheric models and our future ability to interpret atmospheric spectra of habitable exoplanets.
