## Dr. David Toews Ecology Lab 

**Undergraduate Research Assistant** | **Pennsylvania State University**  
*Duration: October 2025 - Present*

While my current research focuses on atmospheric chemistry, particularly the spectral signatures of gases like CH4 and NH3, I am motivated to understand the  biological pathways that produce these molecules and the ecological processes that shape their abundances. My laboratory experience in Dr. David Toews' lab at Penn State, where I applied whole genome sequencing, DNA extraction, PCR analysis, and molecular sexing techniques to support conservation studies of Kirtland's Warbler (songbirds) has given me direct insight into the molecular and metabolic processes that sustain living systems. Combined with my astronomy and atmospheric modeling background, this experience allows me to approach astrobiology from both sides: the biological mechanisms that generate chemical signatures and the atmospheric processes that shape how those signatures appear in exoplanet spectra. This dual perspective strengthens my ability to evaluate whether potential biosignatures originate from biological activity or abiotic chemistry.
